# React Exercise Application

This project is a collection of small React components designed to help you practice and learn React through hands-on exercises. The application includes various components demonstrating different concepts in React, such as state management, effects, and user interaction.

## Features

- **Loading Screen**: Displays a loading message while the main application is being loaded.
- **Random Color Button Component**: A button that changes its color randomly upon being clicked.
- **Change Color Button**: Another button that allows users to change its color by clicking.
- **Moving Button**: A button that moves to a random position within a defined area each time it is clicked.
- **Super Market**: A simple simulation of a shopping cart where users can add products with specific amounts.
- **Market 2**: A more advanced shopping cart system where users can add and remove items, and the total price is dynamically calculated.
- **useEffect Demonstration**: A component demonstrating the use of the `useEffect` hook to manage side effects in a React component.

## Components

### Loading Screen

Displays a "Please wait..." message while the application is being loaded, simulating a loading delay.

### RandomColorButton

This component features a button that changes its color to a random value each time it is clicked. The button color is generated using a random hexadecimal value.

### MovingButton

This component features a button that randomly changes its position within a container when clicked, demonstrating the use of inline styles and state management.

### SuperMarket

A basic shopping cart simulation where users can add items with a specified quantity to their cart. The cart's content is displayed below the input fields.

### Market 2

An advanced shopping cart system that allows users to add and remove products. The total amount of items and the total price are calculated and displayed dynamically.

### Useeffect

A component designed to demonstrate the usage of the `useEffect` hook in React. It tracks changes to various states and logs updates to the console.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- **React**: The main JavaScript library used for building the user interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern JavaScript syntax and features are used throughout the project.
- **CSS**: Basic styling is applied directly within components using inline styles.
- **Node.js and npm**: The project relies on Node.js for package management and running the development server.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PopovEva/react-exercise.git  

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:  
   ```bash
   cd react-exercise  

3. **Install dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   npm install  

The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.   

## How to Use

- Visit each of the components by navigating through the app interface.
- Interact with the buttons and inputs to see how state and effects are managed in React.
- Explore the code to understand how each feature is implemented.

## Learning Objectives

This project is aimed at helping you learn and reinforce the following concepts:

- **State management**: Understanding how to manage state within components using `useState`.
- **Effects**: Learning how to use `useEffect` to handle side effects in your application.
- **Component composition**: Understanding how to break down an application into smaller, reusable components.
- **User interaction**: Handling user inputs and events within React components.
